# Exercise 16

## Concepts

> Which of the following statements are true?

- Bidirectional search takes twice as long as uni-directional search.
- Bidirectional search always finds an answer if the underlying search does.
- **Iterative-Deepening DFS explores no more than twice as many nodes as uni-directional BFS if the branching factor is at least 2.**
- Iterative-deepening depth-first search needs \(O(bd)\) space, for \(b =\) branching factor, \(d =\) depth.


> **Bidirectional search always returns the optimal answer.**

- **False**


## Code

**In the Deep of Knight**

Using the provided function `dl_dfs` in `deepknight_classes.py` complete the function `min_moves` to determine the minimum number of moves a chess knight requires to travel from start to goal on an MxN board.

- `dl_dfs`(board, max_moves, start, goal) performs a depth-limited depth-first search and returns one of three values:

    - True if the goal square can be reached in at most max_moves moves
    - None if unable to determine within max_moves moves whether a path exists
    - False if there definitely is no path.

- `dl_dfs` handles all aspects of the search, such as determining valid neighbors and pruning the search. You can treat it as a black box.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the goal square if the number of moves is less than 100. If the goal can not be reached in less than 100 moves, or can not be reached at all, return -1. The provided harness code prints out the return value.

```
Input:
4,4
0,1
1,0

Output:
2
```

Explanation:

We are given a 4x4 board and asked to go from (0,1) to (1,0). Because a knightâ€™s move is two steps in one direction and one in the perpendicular direction, we can reach (1,3), (2,0), and (2,2) from the initial position in one step. From (1,3) we can go to (2,1) or (3,2), and from (2,0) we can go to (1,2) or (1,3). From (2,2) we can go to (1,0) for a total of two steps.
