## Code

**Bicycle Factory**: We have built a factory for virtual bicycles, with two models available: a mountain bike and a touring bike. Your task is to implement a function which can return either, depending on the number of orders received for each. Complete the function `makeBikes(mtn, tour)` such that it returns a list whose first `mtn` elements are mountain bikes (instances of class MountainBike) and whose remaining `tour` elements are touring bikes (instances of class TouringBike). Note that these need to be separate instances, not multiple references to a single instance (no bike-sharing allowed)! The constructors for these two classes take no arguments.

```py
from lib.bikefactory_classes import *

def makeBikes(mtn, tour):
    bikes = []

    for _ in range(mtn):
        bikes.append(MountainBike())

    for _ in range(tour):
        bikes.append(TouringBike())
    return bikes
```
