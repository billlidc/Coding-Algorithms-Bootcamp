# Exercise 14

## Concepts

> If you want to store a value with a function for later reference, what would you use?

- map()
- reduce()
- **closure**
- generator

> Which of the following are features or advantages of functional programming? Mark all that apply.

- **functions can manipulate other functions**
- **avoiding side effects**
- **functions can be passed as arguments to other functions**
- all functions are global
- functions must have exactly one parameter


## Code

**Functions, Indian-Style**: In functional programming, "currying" is the act of taking a function `f` of `N` arguments and creating a new function `g` of N-1 arguments which returns the same result as `f` with one of its arguments fixed to some value `c`.

Implement the function `curry` which takes as arguments `f` and `c` and returns a function `g(x)` which computes `f(x,c)`.
The locked stub code will call the returned function to verify its correct operation.

```py
def curry(f, c):
    # Return a new function that takes one argument x and applies f(x, c)
    return lambda x: f(x, c)
```

```py
# Example function f that takes two arguments
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

# Currying the function add with the second argument fixed to 5
curried_add = curry(add, 5)

# Now curried_add is a function that takes only one argument
print(curried_add(10))  # Output: 15
```
