# Exercise 11

## Concepts

> In Lomuto partitioning for QuickSort, what invariant does the algorithm maintain?

A. all elements to the left of the "left" pointer are less than the pivot, all right of the "right" pointer are strictly greater than the pivot  
B. all elements to the left of the "left" pointer are less than the pivot, all right of the "right" pointer are greater than or equal to the pivot  
C. **all elements to the left of the imaginary wall are less than the pivot**  
D. all elements to the right of the imaginary wall are greater than or equal to the pivot  


> Which algorithm has the slower worst-case computational complexity?

A. Merge Sort -> $O(n \log n)$  
B. **QuickSort** -> $O(n^2)$  



## Code

**Sort String**: Given a string containing characters from "a" to "z", implement a function to sort the characters of the string in lexicographic order and return a new string. You may use any method you wish to sort the characters.

```
Input: "bdbda"
Output: "abbdd"
```

```py
def sort_string(s):
    return ''.join(sorted(s))

if __name__ == '__main__':
  print(sort_string("bdbda"))
```
