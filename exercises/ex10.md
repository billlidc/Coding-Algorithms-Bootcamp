# Exercise 10

## Concepts

> Which of the following strings would the regular expresssion `\A\d[\s\w]` match? **"1_x2"**

## Code

**Py-lindromes**: Complete the function `isPalindrome`, which takes a single string as input and returns a boolean indicating whether the string is a palindrome.

```py
def isPalindrome(s):
  return s == s[::-1]
```

---

**Leet Filter**: Complete the two functions in `leetfilter.py` to separate those letters which are turned into digits in 1337speak and those which are not. Each function takes a string consisting entirely of lowercase letters ('a' through 'z') and returns the contents of that string after removing individual letters as follows:

- `filter_leet` removes the Leet-speak letters 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'g', 's', 't', and 'z' (which get turned into '4', '3', '1', '0', '9', '5', '7', and '2', respectively)
- `filter_mundane` removes all letters except those removed by `filter_leet`

```
Input: bootcamp

Output:

bcmp
oota
```

```py
import re

def filter_leet(s):
    leet_letters = 'aeiogstz'
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char not in leet_letters])

def filter_mundane(s):
    leet_letters = 'aeiogstz'
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char in leet_letters])

if __name__ == '__main__':
  s = 'bootcamp'
  print(filter_leet(s))
  print(filter_mundane(s))
```
