# Exercise 20

## Concepts

> Which of the following is a true statement about differences between Python and JavaScript?

- Python is a standalone language, Javascript runs only in a browser.
- Python scripts start executing at main(), Javascript programs start with the first line of the script.
- **Javascript has a keyword for variable declarations, Python does not.**
- Python is weakly typed, Javascript is strongly typed.


> Which of the following stores the value 3 in variable `z`?

   ```py
   class Base():
      x = 1
   
   class Derived(Base):
      y = 2 
   
   base = Base()
   derived = Derived()
   base.x = 3
   z = derived.x + derived.y

   # z = derived.x + derived.y = 1 + 2 = 3
   ```

   ```js
   var base = { x : 1 };
   var derived = Object.create(base);
   derived.y = 2;
   base.x = 3;
   var z = derived.x + derived.y;

   // z = derived.x + derived.y = 3 + 2 = 5
   ```

- neither program
- the JavaScript program
- **the Python program**
- both programs


## Coding

**Is it a Number?**

Complete the function `isNumber`, which returns a boolean value indicating whether the given string s is a valid number.

A valid number consists of
- an optional plus or minus sign
- followed by one or more digits (‘0’ through ‘9’)
- optionally followed by a period (‘.’) and one or more digits

```py
export function isNumber(s) {
  const regex = /^[+-]?\d+(\.\d+)?$/;
  return regex.test(s);
}
```
